This folder contains a script "perform_tests.py" that conducts a series of tests on the core code, namely:

    PART 1 - TESTING OF MLS GENERATION
    PART 2 - TESTING OF IR COMPUTATION
    PART 3 - TESTING OF SNR BY COMPENSATION
    PART 4 - TESTING OF LOOP COMPARISON
    PART 5 - TESTING OF SNR BY COMPENSATION
    PART 6 - COMPARING WITH THE OLD MELISSA
    PART 7 - TESTING THE COMPUTATION TIME

All tests generate plots and or pdf files.


Note:
the files "loop1.wav" and "loop_ads_tech.wav" are the self input responses (a.k.a. the output connected to the input)
of the old MLS system and this project, respectively.
